We established forest plots within the University of Michigan properties at two locations, Ann Arbor, SE Michigan, and University of Michigan Biological Station (UMBS), northern Michigan lower peninsula. We established 1 ha (100 x 100m) plots in each of the selected forest stands, four at each location. At each forest plot we set up a 10x10 m grid marked by pvc poles at each intersection delimiting 100  m2 quadrats which were numbered to facilitate the tree census. Elevation at each node of the grid was recorded to generate high-resolution topographic maps of the plots. We used surveying and GPS equipment. In each hectare plot we tagged (with unique numbered tags), identified and measured tree diameter at breast height (dbh, 1.37 m) using tapes or calipers. all trees with at least a dbh of 1 cm were included. Tags were placed at the point-of-measured (POM, 1.37 m) for consistent measurements in further censuses, for small trees POM was marked with tree paint. Trees with several stems at 1.37 m height were marked accordingly and measured. Location in the plot of each tree was recorded.
