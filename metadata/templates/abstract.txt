In this project we established a network of forest inventory plots to gather the data needed to forecast future forest performance under global change. Data collected from forest inventory plots, i.e., size and location of individual trees from all ages and species, have been shown to be particularly useful to link tree species demographic rates (survival, growth, age at maturity, fecundity) with community characteristics (assemblages and species turnovers), and are also widely used to estimate biomass removal (logging) and biomass production (carbon sequestration).
