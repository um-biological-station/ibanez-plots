An added strength of monitoring a network of Forest Plots, not just one stand, is that the same methods are used in data collection across sites, allowing researches to make comparisons along large geographic areas, to detect large-scale trends and to make inferences of species performance under a wide array of environmental conditions. In particular, networks facilitate: i) the detailed study of forest growth, mortality, and recruitment in a changing climate along extensive areas and forest types; ii) assessments of carbon movement through forest ecosystems and the interface between terrestrial systems and the atmosphere; iii) informing earth systems models of climate and terrestrial biomes; iv) recreating past, current, and future patterns of forest biodiversity, phenology, invasions, and biogeochemical cycling; and v) fostering collaborative research funded through national and international funding programs.
